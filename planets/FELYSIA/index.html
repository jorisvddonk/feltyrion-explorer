IN THE SOURTHERN AREA OF THIS QUADRANT, THERE IS AN
IMPRESSIVE ICEBERG SPRINGING FROM THE FROZEN WATERS. WORTHS A VISIT!
ICEBERG DISCOVERED BY ALEX GHIGNOLA, EPOC 6011:557.659
I HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE THE REMAINS OF THE BRAXIS
SYNDICATE&#x27;S MAIN COMPLEX AT 19,41:-48,-5. THE LOCATION FITS MY
MEMORIES OF THE AREA, THOUGH THE GROUND LEVEL DOES SEEM TO HAVE RISEN
SLIGHTLY. IF INVESTIGATING THIS AREA, HOWEVER, REMEMBER TO BE CAREFUL
AROUND THE FRONTAL CLIFF-FACE OF THE VALLEY I BELIEVE TO BE RACKLIS
VALLEY, WHICH IS A DROP THAT WILL SERIOUSLY TEST THE ADAGE THAT A
FELISIAN ALWAYS LANDS ON HIS FEET.
(NOTES BY RYAN BURY, EPOC 6011:557.684)
 ON THE TOP OF THE ICEBERG, THERE&#x27;S A FLAG SAYING &#x27;MANUEL WAS HERE!&#x27;
IN THE 26,41:-48,-20 THERE ARE 2 BIG STRUCTURES. ONE OF THEM IS A
LARGE SQUARE RUIN. THOSE YELLOW CAT-LIKE CREATURES SEEM TO LIKE THE
PLACE. (NOTES BY MANUEL F. LANCTOT, EPOC 6011:561.307)
I&#x27;VE ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL ROWS OF PYRAMIDS, COATED WITH ICE, AND
SEVERAL OTHER HUGE SUTRCTURES OF OBSCURE PURPOSE.
CANT REMEMBER WHERE, THOUGH... :(
CALEB, 6011:567.920
I HAVE FOUND A VERY LARGE CUBE LIKE AREA.
CAT-MADE DEFINATLY. ITS A COMPLEX OF RECTANGULAR SHAPES
THE LANDER SETS DOWN ON TOP OF IT!
THIS PLACE IS AT 86.74
I BELIEVE THIS TO BE ON OF THE HUGE INDOOR CITIES BUILT LONG AGO, AND
HAS BEEN COVERED OVER BY PLANTS WITHOUT MAINTAINENCE. I WOULD EVEN BE
SO BOLD AS TO SAY IT WAS THE CAPITAL CITY OF A COUNTRY.
(NOTES BY EXPLORER EPOC 6011:567.911)
FURTHER NOTES:WELL, I FINALLY MADE IT TO THE HOME OF THE GODS. I SAW A
COUPLE OF AMAZING COMPLEXES AT 359.96 AND 15.47, WHICH I&#x27;M SURE ARE
RECORDED SOMEWHERE IN SOME HISTORICAL ARCHIVE. THE ONE AT 15.47 IS
TEEMING WITH HOPPERS. SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 568.469
I HAVE DONE LITTLE EXLORING AND FOUND ON 330.56 A NEAT MOUND.
I CALL THIS AREA &#x27;SERPENT HILLS&#x27;. LOOK SOUTHEAST. I DARE YOU TO CLIMB
IT. I DID. JUMPING OFF IS LOADS OF FUN.
ALSO AT 238.30 I FOUND AMONG THE NORMAL PYRAMIDAL RUINS TWO LARGISH
RECTANGULAR ONES TO THE WEST. ONE IS STANDING ALONE, THE OTHER IS
IMBEDDED IN A HILL... MAYBE A MILITARY COMPLEX OF SOME SORT?
(NOTES BY EXPLORER EPOC 6011:568.250)
FURTHER NOTES:THERE&#x27;S SOME REALLY STRANGE ARCHITECTURE AT 289.45.
SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 569.336
I CAME HERE JUST TO MAKE SURE, AND I WAS RIGHT. THE WHITE CAT-LIKE
CREATURES, I HAVE DISCOVERED ON HA-KARI PLANET IN THE D&#x27;HARGA SYSTEM,
LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THE CATS YOU CAN MEET ON FELYSIA. THE ONLY EXEPTION
IS THE COLOUR OF THEIR FUR. IF THE THEORY THAT THOSE CREATURES ON THE
FELYSIA PLANET ARE OUR DEGENERATED DESTENDANTS IS RIGHT, THEN I DARE
SAY, THAT SO ARE THE CREATURES FROM HA-KARI PLANET. THAT WOULD MEAN,
THAT THERE USED TO BE A FELYSIAN COLONY IN D&#x27;HARGA SYSTEM. BUT THERE
SEEM TO BE NO REMAINS OF IT LEFT. OR MAYBE THE HA-KARIANS AND FELYSIAN
RACE HAVE A COMMON ANCESTOR? THEESE ARE ONLY THEORIES, OF COURSE, BUT
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD LOOK FOR MORE PLANETS INHABITED BY CREATURES
SIMILIAR TO THE HA-KARI CATS. THAT COULD GIVE US SOME IDEA OF WHAT
HAVE HAPPENED TO THE REST OF FELYSIANS. (NOTE BY MRUQE; 6011-570-487)
I VISITED THAT ICEBERG AT 329,4 - AND COULDN&#x27;T RESIST THE TEMPTATION
TO CLIMB - THE VIEW (SUCH AS IT IS) IS SPECTACULAR. BRIGHT ANYWAY.
(NOTES MADE BY SHADOWCLAW ON 6011:571.103)
LANDING AT THE 15.47 SITE TAKES YOU INTO A SPARCE GROVE OF
TRANSPARENT BUSHES/TREES
ABOVE TWO BY LIONO0
THERE IS A SERIES OF HOLES RUNNING FROM 332.1 TO 354.1.
AMWHERE 6011.572.6
 THERE IS WHAT APPEARS TO BE A FELISIAN-MADE HARBOR AT 343.1
WHY WOULD ANYONE PUT A HARBOR IN THE FROZEN NORTH, HOWEVER, IS UNKNOWN
AWHERE 6011.572.96
341.1 IS A AWESOME PLACE TO EXPLORE. I SUGGEST VISITING THERE.
DEEP CANYON AT 339.1.
IMPACT CRATER AT 337.1.
AMWHERE 6011.572.130
FOUND YET ANOTHER HOLE AT 107.71... WHAT DID OUR ANCESTORS DO TO
MAKE THESE? ARE THE ALL OVER THE PLANET? ONLY FURTHER EXPLORIATION
WILL TELL. AMWHERE 6011.572.131
 LARGE RUIN COMPLEX AT 58.73.
 I FOUND A PAIR OF MASSIVE CUBES AT 48.84. I CONCUR WITH EXPLORER&#x27;S
THEORY THAT THEY WERE DOMED CITIES. I BELIEVE OUR ANCESTORS MOVED
INTO THEM AFTER THEY RUINED THE ENVIRONMENT.
AMWHERE 6011.572.135
INTEREST STRIP OF COLOR AT 194.56.
AFTER SEEING THESE ODD HOLES ACROSS FELYSIA, THIS STARDRIFTER
REALIZED IF ONE WERE TO COVER THEM WITH A CLEAR DOME, THEY WOULD
FIT A TOWN OF SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE. BUT WHY DID OUR ANCESTORS GO
THOUGH ALL THE TROUBLE OF CUTTING THROUGH SOLID ROCK? WHY NOT BUILD
DOMES ON THE SURFACE? IF THEY DID, THEY&#x27;VE BEEN LOST IN THE
TWO THOUSAND EPOCS THEY WOULD BE STANDING; IF THEY IN FACT EXIST.
AMWHERE 6011.572.136
VISITED BY RICHARD SOLENSKY EPOC 6011-571.536.320
LANDED AT 12,25. TWO LINES OF PYRAMIDS TO NORTH (-27.-34)
SMALL AND EASY TO CLIMB.
TO ESE (AT -3.23) IS A BLACK RIDGE ENCLOSING A SQUARE PLOT.
WAS IT BUILT AS A FORT? NO SIGN OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN TREES INSIDE.
TO THE SW (AT 40.-7) IS A MOUNTAIN SPLIT BY A CANYON.
BE CAREFUL - IT&#x27;S A *LONG* HARD CLIMB!
WHAT&#x27;S REALLY ODD HERE IS THAT THERE IS A HIGH, NARROW RIDGE SPANNING
THE CANYON AT 55.-3. WHAT HAPPENED HERE???
WHOLE AREA IS HEAVILY FORESTED.
 ON 287:82 THERE IS A SEA AND
 SOME PYRAMIDS AND A MOUNTAIN
 WHEN YOU DISPATCH IT LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE TRACKS
OF CARS OR SOMETHING...
I BELIEVE THAT FELYSIANS DIED THERE DUE TO THE
FLOODINGS ----FOUND BY MEGAGUN
HAVE BEEN ANALYZING FELYSIAN WEATHER PATTERNS-
FELYSIA HAS A VERY MUGGY ATMOSPHERE, AS FOR THE 5.000 DAYS I OBSERVED,
EVERY ONE HAS BEEN RAINY
(NOTES BY MICHAEL PARKS, EPOC6011:567.811)
 EPOC 6011 584,726 LANDED AT 357;067 JUST NORTH OFA LARGE PLATEAU.
AREA SURRONDED BY LARGE FORT LIKE WALLS AND MEDIUM SIZED PIRAMID.
IN SE DIRECTION FROM LANDING SITE A LARGE STONE FACE CROPING OUT OF
PLATEAU POSSIBLEY FELYSAN MADE. BY 584,727 HAS ASSCENDED STONE FACE.
BY LOOKING AT LANDSCAPE I BELIVE THE AREA TO BE CONNECTED TO FELYSAN
MILLATRY OR A LARGE ORGINISEATION OF SOME SORT.
HEADING NW TOWARDS FORT LIKE STUCTURE. IT APPERS THAT IS IS ONLY
A WALL. BUT AFTER HEADING SW FOR SOMETIME FOUND ANOUTHER END OR WALLED
AREA IN PARRALEL TO EARLYER DISCVOERY. AT TOP OF WALL FACEING NORTH
A LARGE ARAE OF GRASSLAND CANBE SEEN.
 NOTES BY GINJA NINJA 6011: 729
 DISC PAIR OF SQUARE, ATOLL-LKE SEA-FORTS. ONE AT 8.16:-31.16 THE
OTHER A SHORT DIST OFF. LANDED IN BAD WEATHER AND IT WAS A HARD SWIM
TO THE ONE I VISITED. (NOTES BY SCAREDY-CAT, 6011.586.635)
 DISC RUINS OF A LARGE BUILDING AT 13.7:4.11. ALL THAT IS LEFT IS THE
FOUNDATION. ALSO, 2 ROWS OF 8 PYRAMIDS AT 13.7:-2.68 (NOTES BY SCAREDY
(CAT, EPOC 6011.586.636)
 THERE IS AN ISLAND WITH INTERESTING PATTERNS OF PYRAMIDS AND A LARGE
GREEN RECTANGULAR FOUNDATION AT 349.76 (SCAREDY-CAT,6011.586.729)
IN THE WATER DIRECTLY OFF THE COAST AT 62.60:3.-55LAY A SQUARE OF 48
PYRAMIDS12 PER SIDE. A ROW OFSEVERAL PYRAMIDS ALSOIS DOWN THE COAST A
SHORT DISTANCE. (DISC BY MATTHEW COATES,EPOC 6011.586.730)
 312.59 IS INTERESTING B/C OFLONG NARROW FLAT TOP RIDGE. YOU CAN SEE
VARIOUS COMPLEXES AND PYRAMIDS BELOW ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RIDGE. I
RECOMMEND A VISIT TO THIS AREA. LOTS OF WILDLIFE, GOOD PHOTOS
(SCAREDY-CAT, EPOC 6011.586.735)
AT 62.60:-62,-66 THERE IS A TINY ISLAND WITH A HIGH MOUNTAIN.
CLIMBING TO THE TOP GIVES AN INTERESTING VIEW OF A LONG ROW
OF PYRAMIDS. JUST DON&#x27;T LOOK DOWN! (HERBIE, 6011.597.686)
 MY FIRST VISIT TO OUR HOME PLANET WAS NOT A PLEASANT ONE.
IT WAS POURING WITH RAIN AND I FELL INTO A GIANT CHASM FROM WHICH IT
WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO EXIT.
(MURRMURR EPOC 6011 602.710)
 I HAVE VISITED THE COMPLEX AT 15.47 METIONED BY SKINNYMON.
THE PLACE IS INDEED *TEEMING* WITH HOPPERS. ANYONE WHO HAS YET TO SEE
A HOPPER SHOULD VISIT THIS PLACE. (MURRMURR 6011:602.711)
 UPON VISITING THE AREA ALONG THE 312 LINE, I HAVE A NEW IDEA.
INSTEAD OF BEING DOMED CITIES, THESE LARGE HOLES ARE REMINISCENT OF
MASS BURIAL MOUNDS. MY LANDER CAME DOWN ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE RIDGE
UPON CLIMBING AND VIEWING THE AREA FROM ABOVE, IT SEEMS CLEAR FROM THE
PRECISE ORIENTATIONS OF THE PYRAMID MOUNDS THAT THERE IS SOME SORT OF
RITUAL SIGNIFICANCE. THIS MIGHT ALSO EXPLAIN WHY THE AREAS ARE DUG
INTO THE GROUND, INSTEAD OF BEING ON THE SURFACE.
(NOTES BY BGREMAN, 6011:613.59)
NORTH OF THE ICEBURG&#x27;S LANDING SITE I FOUND TWO ROWS OF 6-8 PYRAMIDS..
AFTER THE TWO ROWS, THERE IS AN ISLAND OR SOMETHING THAT IS YET TO BE
DISCOVERED. I DO NOT PLAN A SECON VOYAGE TO FELYSIA, HOWEVER. I WILL
HOPE ANOTHER LOOKS FOR ME. (ANGOLODH-EPOC 6011 607.725)
307:71 FOUND VERY LARGE GRASSY BLOCKS. AFTER SCALING ONE OF THEM
I BELIEVE THAT THEY MAY BE MORE THAN JUST GRASSY BLOCKS.
THEY MAY HOUSE SOMETHING MORE.. LIKE MAYBE A HIDING PLACE FROM THE
DESTRUCTION THAT WAS HAPPENING TO THE PLANET. NO ENTRANCES/EXITS FOUND
THOUGH. IT MAY EVEN BE POSSIBLE THAT THIS IS WHERE THE OTHERS HAVE
GONE, BUT THAT IS JUST SPECULATION ON MY PART.
(MEZURASHII EPOC 6011:608.849)
 ENCOUNTERED TWO ANIMALS TODAY. BOTH WERE CATLIKEWALKING ON ALL FOURS
THEY MOVED AN AN AMASING RATE OF SPEED AND SEEMD AFRAID OF ME. HOWEVE
R EVENTUALLY ONE ANIMAL DID COME CLOSE, AND STOOD UP ON TWO LEGS AS IF
INSPECTING ME, THEN RAN OFF AGAIN. IT WAS QUITE THE SITE AFTER
SPENDING SO MUCH TIME OUT VISITING UNINHABITED PLANETS. IT MAKES ME
WONDER IF THESE NEW FELINES WILL BE THE OWNERS OF OUR HOMEWORLD
THOUSANDS OF YEARS FROM NOW LOCATION WAS SECTOR 194.60 AT 15.-46
(DETJEN HAYNES EPOC 6011.619.461)
 119.9 - A FEW FROZEN LAKES, NOTHING SPECIAL OTHERWISE
 112.21 - A LOT OF RUINS - LOOKS LIKE A KIND OF COMPLEX. ESPECIALLY
SPECTACULAR FROM THE TOP OF A HILL AT 6.-2.
NOTES BY SERPENS, 6011 665.331
 109.85 - AGAIN, A RUINED TOWN. IT SEEMS THAT THEY&#x27;RE ALL OVER THE
PLANET. SERPENS, 6011 665.331
183.97 - SEEMS I&#x27;M REALLY LUCKY. YET ANOTHER COMPLEX OUT THERE.
SERPENS, 6011 665.331
WHERE HAVE ALL THE CATGIRLS GONE? WHAT HAPPEND ONE EPOCH AGO?
FURTHER NOTES:FOUND TWO LARGE CUBE LIKE THINGS, AT 115,44 LANDER LANDS
ON TOP OF IT. NICE VIEVS ON THE OTHER CUBE FROM TOP. JUMING OFF WAS
FUN. TEMP. ON GROUND LEVEL WAS -5 DEGREES, AND ON TOP OF THE CUBE
THE THEMP. WAS -15.5 DERGEES. SEEN A HOPPER JUMPING OFF THE CUBE.
NOTES BY MCWGOGS, EPOC 6011.647.618.
FOUND LOTS OF INTERESTING ARCHITECTURE AT 310:60. THIS AREA IS TEEMING      
WITH WILDLIFE. FOUND WHAT APPEARED TO BE A ROAD IN THE DISTANCE.            
INBOX

I FORGOT HOW VERDANTLY GREEN FELYSIA WAS :)                                 
AS WELL AS THE BRXIS RUINS, AT 19,41:-48,-5 THERE IS ANOTHER SET AT         
19,41:-32,-13,THEY ARE IN VISIBLE RANGE OF ONE ANOTHER

EPOC 6011, ARCHEOS&#x27; JOURNAL. I&#x27;VE BEEN AT THE MYSTERIUOS CUBE LIKE          
FACILITYAT 86.74, ITS FASCINATING TO SEE HOW THE STRANGE CAT CREATURES      
MOVE IN THE ZONE. BEWARE THE CENTRAL AREA, NOT FAR FROM THE LANDING         
POINT, FALLING THERE MEANS TROUBLE TO COME BACK.

I FOUND A SEA AT 175.50 IN MY FIRST VISIT TO OUR HOMEWORLD.                 
AT 175.51 IS AN ISLAND (?), FEW LIFEFORMS, MANY SMALL PONDS. LOOKS          
REAALY NICE! I INTEND TO XPLORE THE SEA AROUND, LATER...                    
AT 174.50: -77.46 LARGE COMPLEX BY SIDE OF A HILL-CITY? SOME BASE?...       
(NOTES BY CATRANGER, EPOC 6011: 717.697)                                    
 A HUGE CUBE DISC AT 48.50. PLACE LIKE ISLAND...BUT LARGE ONE.              
IT IS A PLATEAU,HEAVILY FORESTED BUT POORLY INHABITED-JUST BIRDS AND        
A PAIR OF HORNED MAMMALS.THE CUBE MIGHT BE AN OLD HOUSELIKE STRUCTURE       
AS WAS ONCE SUGGESTEDBY OTHERS.I DO NOT KNOW WHY THEY BUILT IT THOUGH       
INSTEAD OF DIGGING INTO THE LARGE HILLY PLATEAU NEARBY...                   
BUT MAYBE THEY DID FIRST,CAUSE I FOUND A HUGE SQUARE PIT-UNDER FLOOD.       
MAYBE THAT IS WHY THEY LEFT THEIR FLOODED CITIES UNDERGROUND AND BUILT      
THE CUBES.I HEARD OF SUCH STRUCTURES ELSEWHERE...                           
NOTES BY CATRANGER, EPOC 6011,717.702                                       
I HAVE BEEN REVIEWING THE TEXT THAT AMWHERE HAD ENTERED AND I HAVE          
AN IDEA ABOUT THE AMZINGLY HUGE SQUARE HOLES... I THINK THAT THEY           
WERE MINES BECAUSE THEY SAY THE STARDRIFTERS ARE MADE OUT OF                
QUARTZ. SO IM THINKING THAT AFTER OUR ANCESTORS INCINERATED THE MOON        
FROM ALL THE MINING THEY WENTFOR THE PLANET AND MINED ALL THE QUARTZ        
TO MAKE THE STARDRIFTERS. SO THERE FOR I THINK THEHOLES ARE MINES THEY      
LOOK ABOUT THE SAME SIZE OF THE SHIPS.                                      
ALSO I ACTULLY CAUGHT A BIRDIT WAS SO COOL. IM FINDING MY ANCETERAL         
 INTINCTS.                                                                  
 359.96 - A GOOD PLACE FOR A QUICK SNACK. BEAUTIFUL SURROUNDINGS, TOO.      
 LANDED AT LQ 229:072 AND FOUND TWO DOUBLE-ROWS OF PYRAMIDS. GOING TO       
-16.-11, YOU CAN LOOK TO THE NORTH AND WEST AND SEE THEM. YOU CAN ALSO      
SEE THEM ON DESCENT (NOTES BY DAWIWO, EPOCH 6011:768.511)                   
LQ 160:092 IS A WONDERFUL SPOT! THE WEATHER WAS PERFECT WITH A FEW          
CLOUDS. IT WAS HIGHLY DEVELOPED IN THE PAST APPARENTLY AND MAY HAVE         
BEEN VERY GOOD FOR CROPS. THE LAND IS COMPLETELY COVERED IN TALL GRASS      
AND IF YOUR EYES ARE NOT USE TO SEEING SO MUCH MOVE AT ONCE, THEY MAY       
TAKE SOME TIME TO GET USED TO IT -- BUT THE HUNTING WAS GOOD. GOT A         
GOOD MEAL HERE. THERE IS A STRUCTURE, POSSIBLY AN OLD BUILDING AT           
-65,-50 AND GIVES A GOOD VEW OF THE SURROUNDINGS. TO THE NW YOU CAN         
FIND A VERY INTERESTING GROUND STRUCTURE. -41.-31 IS A GOOD PLACE TO        
GET A VIEW OF THE AREA. THERE IS A DROP TO A BOWL-LIKE AREA BELOW. THE      
OLD BUILDING AT 92.46 CAN BE CLIMBED, BUT IT MUST BE APPROACHED AT AN       
ANGLE. THERE IS MORE TO SEE AROUND IT FROM THE TOP. THIS LOCATION AND       
SURROUNDINGS ARE WORTH VISITING! (NOTES BY DAWIWO, EPOCH 6011:768.512)      
IF THIS JOB EVER ENDS, OR FOR A FINAL RESTING PLACE, I WANT TO LIVE BY      
92.56:41.55 - BEAUTIFUL BOWL WITH AN OPENING TO THE NORTH. WHERE IS         
DREAMER? IT SHOULD BE RIGHT HERE AND DECORATE THE SKY FOR A SMALL VIEW

VISITED FELYSIA TODAY. SPARSE VEGITATION, SOME PLANTLIFE, AND               
ION STORMS. WAS GLAD TO GET BACK TO POD.                                    </pre></div></div></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/planets/FELYSIA";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"app":["/app-53ce1436626cb35f7f3a.js"],"component---src-templates-star-info-tsx":["/component---src-templates-star-info-tsx-c8fd4c022c5caa14565e.js"],"component---src-templates-planet-info-tsx":["/component---src-templates-planet-info-tsx-b7fbbe6ea8d84b952fe0.js"],"component---src-pages-404-tsx":["/component---src-pages-404-tsx-1dd42663bd160513d7da.js"],"component---src-pages-index-tsx":["/component---src-pages-index-tsx-b5ea189751e8a4211fa2.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/feltyrion-explorer/component---src-templates-planet-info-tsx-b7fbbe6ea8d84b952fe0.js" async=""></script><script src="/feltyrion-explorer/commons-de7dd3190c7a7f46ad4f.js" async=""></script><script src="/feltyrion-explorer/styles-4ac1af71c45299950066.js" async=""></script><script src="/feltyrion-explorer/app-53ce1436626cb35f7f3a.js" async=""></script><script src="/feltyrion-explorer/webpack-runtime-d698ff593d86bc2d08e7.js" async=""></script></body></html>
