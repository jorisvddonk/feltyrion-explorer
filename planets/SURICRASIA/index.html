LEAST FROM MY POINT OF VIEW. NOBODY SHOULD MISS THE SURICRASIAN SKY AT
THE SUNRISE: ITS SCARLET SHADES ARE - WHAT COULD I SAY? - INSPIRING!
ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING QUADRANTS IS AT COORDINATES 18:60, WHERE THE
SO-CALLED &#x27;SURICRASIAN CUBE&#x27;, AN IMMENSE AND ANCIENT STRUCTURE NOW
COVERED WITH GRASS, IS SURROUNDED BY SMALL LAKES WHOSE WATERS PLAY WITH
THE REFLECTIONS OF ANCIENT BUILDINGS. AND TALKING OF LAKES, THERE IS AN
ARTIFICIAL LAKE AT COORDINATES 219:78, WHERE A SQUARE OF PILLARS ERUPTS
FROM THE GROUND BELOW THE WATER. MOST OF THE PLANET&#x27;S SURFACE IS NOW
DESERT, AND VEGETABLES ARE RARE, PROBABLY BECAUSE THERE ARE NO OCEANS OR
LARGE SEAS. NONETHELESS, THE ATMOSPHERE IS RICH IN VAPOUR, WHICH FORMS A
LARGE NUMBER OF CLOUDS ESPECIALLY NEAR THE PLANET&#x27;S EQUATOR.
NOTES WRITTEN BY ALEX GHIGNOLA, EPOC 6011:557.470
ON 46.102 I FOUND SOME RATHER ODD LANDFORMS.
THEY ARE BIG ODD PURPLE MOUNDS.
ONE OF THEM HAS A GREEN MOUND IN THE CENTER OF THE PURPLE.
(NOTE BY EXPLORER EPOC 6011:568.334)
FURTHER NOTES:AS I RECALL, MY MOTHER SPOKE ILL OF SURICRASIA, BUT
THAT WAS PROBABLY BECAUSE OF MY FATHER, A SON OF A HOPPER WHO WAS
NEVER THERE WHEN HE WAS NEEDED. BUT ENOUGH OF THAT.
ACTUALLY, EXPLORER WAS ACCURATE: SIMILAR FINDS AT 337.42, 347.43
AND 38.62. HOWEVER, I NOTICED AT THE LAST LOCATION, THE &#x27;PINK&#x27;
HAD WALLS. THIS MAY BE EXCAVATION, WHO KNOWS? HOWEVER, AT 359.44
BEWARE, YOU&#x27;LL LAND ON AN EDGE. ALSO THERE IS A BIG PINK MONOLITH
STRUCTURE. AT ANY RATE, I DECIDED TO DO A SUNRISE. SO I
WENT TO 186.58. THERE&#x27;S AN ISLAND THERE, AND PROBABLY THE ONLY
PLANT LIFE YOU&#x27;LL SEE ON THE PLANET. A FOREST. AND I SAW THE
SUNRISE ON THE OCEANSIDE. QUITE NICE. SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 570.831
I FOUND A WEIRD, PURPLE, SQUARE CANYON AND A PURPLE OBELISK AT:
THESE COORDINATES: 263:24 AND 313:35. OVERTILT EPOC &#x27;11 571.549.300
 A WIERD MOUND AT 285.63. IT IS ONE OF THE HOLES THAT ARE FOUND BOTH
BOTH PLEASANCE AND FELYSIA. AMWHERE 6011.572.217
IMPOSSIBLY INCREDIBLY UNBELIEVABLY REALLY HUGE BUILDING AT 153.37
HOW TALL IS IT? WHEN YOU LAND/TAKEOFF, THE LANDER &#x27;APPEARS&#x27;/&#x27;DIS-
APPEARS&#x27; JUST *ABOVE* ITS TOP!!!! YOU *CAN&#x27;T* SEE OVER IT!!!
COVERS A LOT OF GROUND, TOO - FARTHEST CORNER AT 153.37:-36.-72
FOUND BY RICHARD SOLENSKY EPOC 6011-578.524.300
AT 281.73, YOU&#x27;LL LAND ON TOP OF A HUGE CUBE WITH 2 ROWS OF 10
PYRAMIDS EACH ON TOP. I ESTIMATE, FROM THE TIME IT TAKES TO REACH
THE BOTTOM WHEN YOU JUMP OFF, THAT IT&#x27;S ABOUT A *MILE* HIGH!
FOUND BY RICHARD SOLENSKY EPOC 6011-581.893.048
AT 46.53 THERE ARE TWO ALMOST STARDRIFTER-SHAPED PURPLE OBJECTS,
AND A SPIRE CLOSE BY. THERE DOESN&#x27;T SEEM TO BE ANY CATNIP THERE
THOUGH. ;-) (SHADOWCLAW 6011:583.802)
225.60 IS INTERESTING. I&#x27;M NOT SAYING ANY MORE. (SHADOWCLAW)
 CONFIRMATION OF EXPLORER SOLENSKY&#x27;S CUBE.FURTHER EXPLORATION AT
BASE OF CUBE REVEALED A SPRAWLING GREY FORTRESS-LIKE STRUCTURE.
LOCATION OF STRUCTURE IS 281.73:5.-44. THE CLIMB BACK TO THE TOP
OF THE CUBE TOOK SEVERAL100 TRIADS DEXTER. (NOTES BY SCAREDY-CAT,
 EPOC 6011.584.95)
I THINK I HAVE FOUND THE CUBE&#x27;S BIG BROTHER! YES, YOU HEARD THAT
CORRECTLY, THERE&#x27;S ANOTHER CUBE AT COORDINATES 43:33 AND IT&#x27;S
MONSTROUSLY GIGANTIC! THE TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
WAS ABOUT 8 DEGREES CELSIUS. THE TOP OF THE CUBE IS TOO LARGE FOR
SECTOR BOUNDARIES. THE PURPLE SUNSET MADE THE WHOLE SCENE EVEN
MORE SURREAL. (WRITTEN BY SCHMERM 6011 579.904)
I AM SPEECHLESS... THE CUBE THAT I MENTIONED IN THE ABOVE ENTRY
IS GONE!!! IN ITS LOCATION IS NOW A CUBIC HOLE IN THE GROUND WITH
A LARGE MOUND INSIDE. YOU WILL FIND THIS SOUTH OF THE LANDING SITE
AT 43:33, PAST THE LARGE STRUCTURE IN THE WAY, AT SUBCOORDS 59.15,
IGNORING + OR - SIGNS OF COURSE. IN OTHER NEWS, THE CUBE HAS
MYSTERIOUSLY MOVED TO 11:41 AS OF THIS TIME. (SCHMERM 6011 584.37)
FURTHER NOTES:A REPORT DECRIBING A &#x27;VANISHING&#x27; STRUCTURE AT 153.37
MANAGED TO REACH ME, AND SINCE I WAS IN THE VICINITY, I
INVESTIGATED. NO LARGE STRUCTURE WAS THERE, BUT THERE WAS WHAT
APPEARED TO BE A MINING HILLSIDE AND A LARGE EVIL PIT SOME DISTANCE
AWAY, AND A FEW PYRAMIDS. I DECIDED TO CONDUCT A SEARCH OF THE
AREAS IMMDIATELY SURROUNDING 153.37, OUT OF CURIOSITY. AT 152.36
I LANDED TWICE WHERE THERE WAS TWO CUBES, ONE AT A DISTANCE WITH
8 SPOTS ON TOP, THE OTHER I LANDED ON. IT HAS A CALDERA THAT LEADS
TO A DANGEROUS LARGE GAPING SHAFT. I LANDED THERE AGAIN LATER AND
THE DISTANT CUBE WAS GONE. AT 152.36 IT WAS HILLY WITH NOTHING OF
INTEREST. AT 154.36, A WATERY GRAVE AWAITS YOU WITH A COLLECTION
OF PYRAMIDS IN THE WATER. AT 154.37 HILLY AND NOTHING OF INTEREST.
AT 154.38, A LARGE RECTANGULAR STRUCTURE AND ANOTHER CUBE. AT
153.38, THERE&#x27;S A REALLY, REALLY, REALLY STRANGE LOOKING STRUCTURE.
LOOKS LIKE THIN WALLS WITH ENORMOUS CRACKS GOING DOWN. I DON&#x27;T
KNOW WHY THIS THING HASN&#x27;T COLLAPSED OVER THE EPOCS. THERE&#x27;S A
SMALLER STRUCTURE NEARBY. IT&#x27;S WORTH A VISIT. AT 152.38 IT LOOKS
LIKE YOUR BASIC MARSHLAND TO ME. AT 152.37 THERE I SAW AN ENORMOUS
WALL WITH ANOTHER LARGE RECTANGULAR STRUCTURE NEARBY. I REVISITED
152.37 AND FOUND THE WALL AND THE TALL STRUCTURE HAD BEEN REPLACED
BY MOUNDS OF PURPLE MATERIAL- WITH HOPPERS JUMPING UP AND DOWN.
AGAIN, AT 153.37 WHAT APPEARS TO BE A CUBE WITH A PURPLE FACE HAD
APPEARED. I EXPANDED MY SEARCH TO FORM A &#x27;FELISIAN GRID&#x27; (5X5). AT
151.36, IN THE WATER, A &#x27;STARFISH&#x27; SPIRE AND A FLAT STRUCTURE WITH
WHAT APPEARS TO BE A GRASSY MOUND ON TOP. AT 151.37 IT WAS FLAT
WITH SOME BUSHY PLANT LIFE, BUT NO STRUCTURES. AT 151.38, AN
ENORMOUS PURPLE CUBE. AT 155.36, A TALL RECTANGULAR STRUCTURE AND
A NEARBY SCRAPED OUT CLIFF. AT 155.37, A TALL RECTANGULAR STRUCTURE
AT 155.38 AND 151.39 IT&#x27;S HILLY WITH NOTHING REMARKABLE. AT 152.39
THERE&#x27;S A TALL PURPLE CUBE WITH A MOUNDLIKE PROJECTION ON TOP. AT
153.39, IT WAS HILLY, NOTHING REMARKABLE. AT 154.39 A VERY LARGE
PURPLE CUBE. AT 155.39 A TALL PURPLE SPIRE WITH MANY GOUGES IN THE
SOIL. AT 155.35, A PURPLE &#x27;STARFISH&#x27; SPIRE AND A VERY LARGE PITLIKE
AREA.AT 154.35, UPON LANDING, I REALIZED THERE WERE CORNERS TO THE
LANDING AREA. I WAS ATOP A LARGE CUBE WITH A SMALLER STRUCTURE WITH
A PURPLE FACADE NEARBY; HOWEVER, INTERESTINGLY AS I LANDED ON TOP
OF THE CUBE, I WAS GREETED BY...A HOPPER. AT 153.35, A RECTANGULAR
STRUCTURE AND A GOUGE WITH A LARGE PURPLE MOUND. AT 152.35 THERE
WAS A SMALL HILLY FOREST. AT 151.35 IN THE WATER AGAIN WITH MORE
FLAT OBJECTS WITH MOUNDS ON TOP AND WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE TOP OF
A SPIRE. CONTINUING THE &#x27;FELISIAN GRID&#x27; CONCEPT CENTERED ON THE
SURICRASIAN CUBE, AT 18.60, OF COURSE THERE WAS THE CUBE AND DON&#x27;T
FORGET THE NEARBY &#x27;PIT OF DOOM&#x27; TOWARD THE EAST. (FUN FOR THE WHOLE
FAMILY!). AT 19.60, THERE IS A LARGE PIT AREA WHICH HAS A LIGHT
COLORED FRINGE ALMOST LIKE A PATHWAY ALL AROUND IT. THERE&#x27;S WHAT
APPEARS TO BE A STELE IN THE DISTANCE. AT 17.61 THERE&#x27;S A CUBE WITH
AN ORGANIC-LOOKING DOME ON TOP. ANOTHER &#x27;PATHWAY&#x27; GOES IN FRONT OF
THE CUBE AND HEADS IN THE DIRECTION OF A STELE IN THE DISTANCE TO
THE WEST. AT 18.61 THERE&#x27;S ONLY A PURPLE &#x27;FLOWING&#x27; AREA IN THE
DISTANCE. AT 19.61 AND 19.60 THERE&#x27;S NOTHING BUT HILLY GROUND. AT
19.59 THERE&#x27;S A PIT WITH AN EDGE TO THE EAST, TWO CUBES TO THE WEST
AT 18.59, A FORESTED AREA. AT 17.59, LANDED ON TOP OF ANOTHER CUBE
WITH A SHAFT, HOWEVER, THE CALDERA AROUND THE SHAFT LOOKS CRACKED.
SAW ANOTHER HOPPER ATOP THIS CUBE AND I TRIED TO FOLLOW HIM, AND HE
DISAPPEARED, BUT I SAW WHY- HE WAS TRYING TO LEAD ME INTO A
PIT-LIKE AREA. (THE LITTLE TWERP!) AT 16.59 DESCEND ON LANDING
INTO A PIT-LIKE AREAWITH &#x27;WAVY&#x27; WALLS AND PYRAMIDS INSIDE. THERE&#x27;S
A GAP AREA AT ONE END AND THE WHOLE THING IS OVERLOOKED BY A CUBE
ABOVE THE PIT. LOOKS LIKE AN ESTATE OWNED BY A SURICRASIAN
OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE BARON. :) AT 16.60 THERE&#x27;S NOTHING ASIDE
FROM A TALL PEAK TO THE SOUTH. AT 16.61 THERE&#x27;S NOTHING BUT HILLY
GROUND. AT 16.62 THERE&#x27;S A LARGE UNNATURAL GAP OFF TO THE NORTH-
PROBABLY NOTHING. AT 17.62, NOTHING BUT HILLY GROUND. AT 18.62,
TWO LARGE PITS. AT 19.62 THERE&#x27;S A VERY TALL CYLINDRICAL STRUCTURE
(NO CORNERS) SITTING IN A PIT. AT 20.62, NOTHING BUT HILLY GROUND.
AT 20.61 A LARGE PIT NEAR FORESTED GROUND AND AN UNNATURAL NOTCH
TO THE WEST. AT 20.60, A FLAT BUILDING WITH A MOUND (AS I&#x27;VE SEEN
IN THE WATER HERE), PYRAMIDS, A SMALL STRUCTURE; THE AREA IS
COVERED WITH MANY PONDS (WATERS RECEEDING?) AT 20.59 A CUBE AND A
SPIRE. AT 20.58, NOTHING BUT HILLY GROUND. AT 19.58, A LARGE PIT.
AT 18.58 A FEW ISLANDS WITH BUSHES. NICE BEACH FRONT FOR SWIMMING
AND SUNNING (SWIMMING I HATE. SUNNING IS OK, BUT AFTER A WHILE MY
FUR GETS TOO WARM.) AT 17.58, TALL PEAKS WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN
UNNATURAL GAP ON THE HORIZON, PYRAMIDS. AT 16.58 A COUPLE OF LARGE
PITS. (ONE WITH ONE OF THOSE UNNATURAL GAPS.) THERE&#x27;S NO GUARANTEE
AS TO WHETHER ANY OF THINGS WILL EXIST IF YOU VISIT THESE AREAS,
ASIDE FROM THE HILLY GROUND ONES, BUT I THOUGHT THE EPLORATION WAS
WORTH THE EFFORT. SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 579.540
 COMPLEX OF 4 LOW CUBES, EACH TOPPED WITH A DOME AT 346.68. ALL ARE
GRAY,BUT 1 HAS A GREEN DOME. OH, THEY ARE ALL SURROUNDED BY H20.
AND THERE ARE 2 SMALL ISLANDS TO REST ON NEARBYOBJECTS ARE COVERED
BY WILD LIFE. I WONDER WHAT THEY WERE USED FOR.
PERHAPS A SEA PORT. DEFINITLY WORTH A LOOK.(SCAREDY-CAT6011.587.896
 HUGEGRASS COVERED MILE HIGH CUBE AT 56.60. ON TOP I SAW A HOPPER
JUMP OFF THE EDGE. THEN, RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME AANOTHER APPEARED
OUT OF THIN AIR AND THEN JUMPED OFF. ONE AFTER ANOTHER DID THIS
AND I HAVE NAMED THIS
LEMMING CUBE (SCAREDY-CAT, EPOC 6011.588.373)
 55.60 IS INTERESTING. LARGE GREY CUBE TOPPED WITH GREEN DOME AT
TOP OF DOME IS A SQUARE ELEVATOR SHAFT WHICH DESCENDS TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE CUBE. CUBE IS SURROUNDED BY A DRY MOAT. CANYONS, HILLS AND
A LARGE GREY PIT WITH A LOW GREY DOME IS IN THEAREA (SCAREDY-CAT,
6011.588.376)
VISITED THE STARDRIFTER COMPLEX NOTED ABOVE. SAW ANOTHER
TRICHORDITE COMPLEX AND ALSO NOTED THAT THE SHIP-SHAPED COMPLEXES
ARE ON A RIVER BANK. COULD THESE BE CRASH SITES OR SEAPORTS?
(NOTES: JIM GAMMA, 6011:594.656)
 0 0 WOW. THAT&#x27;S A LOT OF NOTES N&#x27; STUFF. (TGD)
 OOPS. SORRY ABOUT THAT.
55.60;FOUND THE LARGE PURPLE CUBE, MANAGED TO JUMP TO THE TOP...
STILL FIGURING HOW I DID IT, ANYWAY CLIMBED THE DOME AND FELL
DOWN THE ELEVATOR SHAFT. WICKED *LONGDROP*!
ROLAND ASKEW (EPOC 6011 598.824)
 AFTER A LONG ABSENCE, I HAVE RETURNED TO SURICRASIA. I INTEND TO
EXPLORE SOME OF THE NORTHERN AREAS THAT I DID NOT BEFORE. I WILL
THEN GO BACK INTO DEEP SPACE.(SCAREDY-CAT, 6011.602.546)
 A PAIR OF DOME-TOPPED LOW CUBES AT 355.13. THEY ARE SET INTO A
FROZE SEA. THEY REMIND ME OF A PAIR OF STARDRIFTERS BECAUSE OF THE
REFLECTION. (NOTE BY SCAREDY-CAT, EPOC 6011.602.979)
 MOST UNUSUAL TERRAIN AT 253.56. TWO VERY LARGEPITS AND TWO VERY
LARGE CUBES. I SCALED ONE CUBE. IT WAS VERY HARD TO CLIMB. I HAD
EXPECTED TO ROAM AROUND AT THE TOP, BUT AS SOON AS I REACHED IT, I
BEGAN TO FALL ALL THE WAY TO THE BASE. APPARENTLY, THIS CUBE WAS
HOLLOW, LIKE A BOX WITH NO LID. AT THE BOTTOM WAS A DOME AND A VERY
DOCILE HOPPER WHO DIDN&#x27;T GO ANYWHERE THE WHOLE TIME I WAS THERE.
THIS IS WORTH A LOOK TO EXPLORER WHO WANT TO SEE SOMETHING UNUSUAL
(SCAREDY-CAT, EPOC 6011.603.154)
 AT 280:85 I&#x27;VE FOUND A GIANT CUBE AND A FEW INTERESTING MOUNTAINS.
AT 287.79 I&#x27;VE SEEN A TRULY GIGANTIC CUBE. AMAZING...
308.31 - ANOTHER CUBIC FORMATION AND PURPLE MOUNTAINS ON THE
HORZON.
127.35 - TWO STUNNING FORMATIONS. UNBELIEVABLE... IS THERE A MORE
